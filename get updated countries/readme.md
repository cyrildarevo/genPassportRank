# create a country list 

### `cd` into directory and type `python createCountryList.py`

so the fillsomepeopleinfo.py takes a list of dictionaries from country_list_0.py and fills some of the obvious demonyms by searching the wikipedia_people.txt file to se if the demonym is used in the wikipedia page for visa requirements for the country. if it does it assigns the demonym and saves the whole list in country_list.py

you gotta fill in the others manually in country_list after running fillsomepeopleinfo.py via createCountryList.py
